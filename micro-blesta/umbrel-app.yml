version: "5.10.2"
tagline: The billing platform for hosting providers
description: >-
  Blesta is well-written, open, and developer friendly; It is no wonder it has become the first
  choice among a growing number of hosting providers worldwide.
  
  
  Blesta is well-written, source documented, object oriented code that is nearly 100% open.
  Less than 1%, or only 3 files are encoded â€” just enough for license protection. Is your current
  billing system this open? There is nothing like having the source code at your finger tips.
  If you are a developer, you will love Blesta!
