  Deprecation Notice: Ubiquiti mFi is no longer on active development. Compatible only with x86-64 processors.
  
  
  mFi® is a Machine-to-Machine management system from Ubiquiti Networks®. mFi hardware is managed and
  monitored from the mFi Controller software.
  
  
  The mFi Controller allows you to create rules that trigger actions based on data from your mFi sensors.
  For example, motion detection can turn a light on, or a high temperature reading can trigger a fan.
  
  
  The mFi platform is compatible with third‑party devices, making the options unlimited!
