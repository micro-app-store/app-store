description: >-
  Growing an ISP requires highly skilled employees and costly, complex systems.
  
  
  UISP, our end-to-end platform, reduces these overhead concerns by streamlining network creation,
  maintenance, and subscriber management, so you can focus solely on growing your business.
  
  
  Plan your network with the UISP Design Center, set up and align your devices with the UISP Mobile app,
  and monitor customer billing from a centralized UISP server.
releaseNotes: >-
  UISP Application 2.4.143 is a new version aimed at stabilizing and further improving the previous stable version 2.4.93.


  Network:
   - All notes, notifications, and devices under legacy subscribers were migrated to classic ones. CRM options were updated accordingly.
   - Added the DNS Server configuration in the side panel of UISP-R/C devices with FW >= 5.0.0.
   - Added the Interfaces configuration in the side panel of UISP-R/C devices with FW >= 5.0.0.
   - Added backup radio data to the utilization statistics.
   - Added the Remote Access feature for EdgeSwitch X devices.
   - Added automatic disable of an ONU device assigned to a suspended subscriber. ONU remains active in UISP, but it doesn't provide service.
   - Improved the FW upgrade manager. It now prevents the user from upgrading cs to non-cs FW (this may be done via the device's local web UI). If the user has a cs FW then it can be only upgraded to another cs version. The same works for lite FW versions. If the FW is non-cs + non-lite, then it can be only upgraded to another non-cs + non-lite version in UISP.
   - Improved device statistics to show traffic for all ports.
   - Improved the location of Switch to Static IP action in the side panel of UISP-R devices.
   - Improved the password generation algorithm. It now meets new stricter criteria.
   - Improved the situation when your UISP GUI cannot reach the UISP server. The error message is now more clear.
  
  CRM:
   - Added a new field "isAdmin" to ticket comments in Client Zone API.
   - Added a new webhook event for service outage, separated from the service edit event.
   - Allowed ending a quoted service via API.
